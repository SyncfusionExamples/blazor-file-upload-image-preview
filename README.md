## Overview

The [Blazor File Upload](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-file-upload?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=blazor-file-upload-github-samples) is a component for uploading one or multiple files, images, documents, and audio and video files to a server. The File Upload works in both WebAssembly and Server-side Blazor apps, and also supports a rich set of features that include multiple file selection, progress bars, auto-uploading, drag and drop, folder (directory) uploading, file validation, and more.

## Features and Benefits

## Upload large files

Manage large file uploads efficiently without any performance degradation using chunk upload. The large files are sliced into small chunks and upload to the server in sequential order for asynchronous mode.

## Resumable upload

A built-in feature is available to pause, resume, retry, and cancel a file upload. This helps users upload high-resolution images, videos,and other large files safely. Additionally, it provides an option to pause and resume automatically based on server connection.

## Multiple file upload

Users can select multiple files and upload them to a server at the same time, which is useful for uploading images to a gallery and file sharing applications.

## Drag and drop

The Blazor file upload component can upload multiple files by simply dragging them from the file explorer to the drop area (drop zone), which is a more user-friendly way to select and upload multiple files.

## Custom file upload button

The action buttons of the Blazor file upload component are completely customizable, including its file list, which helps you create your own design for the Blazor file upload UI.

## File types (file extensions)

Users can upload various file types and impose restrictions to allow only valid types of files from the client-side, which is mandatory before uploading a file in the web application.

## File validation (filter)

Users can add validation to check file size limits with minimum and maximum ranges, number of files required, total size, and MIME type before uploading a file to a server.

## Upload folder (directory)

The component accepts a folder (directory) as a file source for uploading. It uploads all the files (includes subfolders) of the selected folder.

## Paste image to upload

The Blazor file upload component processes images from the clipboard, also. Simply copy and paste the images to be uploaded to a server.

## Delete uploaded files

The Blazor file upload component provides a simple interface to delete files from a server after uploading them, which helps you delete wrongly uploaded files.

## Preload uploaded files

Users can configure previously uploaded files from the server with a success state, which is useful for viewing, removing, and manipulating them.

## Auto-upload

Users can initiate an automatic upload to upload files immediately upon adding them to the upload queue.

## Progress bar

The component displays a built-in progress bar (progress indicator) with the progress percentage during each file upload. It is completely customizable.

## Localization

Users can set corresponding translation texts to the static strings used in the Blazor file upload component through the localization library.

## Right-to-left (RTL)

The Blazor file upload component supports right-to-left rendering, which improves the user experience and accessibility for those who use RTL languages.

## Standard HTML forms

The Blazor file uploader component has form support (synchronous mode) to work with native HTML forms.
